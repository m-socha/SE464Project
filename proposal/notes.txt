Name: WatNotes

FPs:
-upload notes - share them
  -importing
  -exporting
-discovering
  -search by course, topic, uploader
  -discussions on notes (e.g. commenting on note, discussion forum for each note set, etc.)
-editing/collaborating on notes
  -combining handwritten notes with electronic edits (e.g. comment boxes, Latex comments, etc.) - let's keep this open-ended

Use Scenarios:
1. Student who needs notes because they missed lecture
2. Student uploads notes to help people 

NFPs:
-performant - we're going to be loading moderately-sized files (images, pdfs, etc), and unresponsiveness is known to be detrimental to the user experience.
-fault-tolerance - save progress of users locally (eduroam sucks, so if it disconnects, we don't want a user comment to be wiped)
-evolvability - open-ended project, so we will build extensible architecture to accommodate future features
