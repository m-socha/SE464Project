# Watnotes frontend

The Watnotes frontend is written in JavaScript and uses React for the UI. It
servers pages with a Node.js web server, and communicates with the Watnotes
Python backend to store and retrieve data.

## Setup

Run `npm install`.

## Run

Run `npm start`, and then visit `localhost:3000`.

### TODO

- [ ] import css library (eg materialize) and configure with webpack
- [ ] build react components
- [ ] integrate redux/flux into frontend for state management/communication with api
- [x] add styleguide
